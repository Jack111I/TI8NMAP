🌌 TI8NMAP BY SAYO
[ THE ULTIMATE FULL-SPECTRUM TACTICAL COMMAND CENTER ]
> STATUS: SYSTEM STABILIZED | CORE: PYTHON0.X | MODE: FREE TIER ENABLED
> 
⚡ MISSION STATEMENT
TI8NMAP is not just a scanner; it is a War-Room Interface for the modern security auditor. By combining asynchronous parallel processing with a high-fidelity D3.js Force-Directed Topology, it provides a real-time visual map of the digital battlefield. No "goofy" XP matrix effects—just raw, actionable intel delivered through a sleek Obsidian-Slate UI.

🛠️ THE TI8 SUITE;
🛰️ PHASE 1: THE INTELLIGENCE GRID
 * Parallel Asynchronous Engine: Execute deep scans across entire subnets simultaneously without UI freezing or performance drops..
 * WiFi Spectrum Sniffer: Leverages native hardware (netsh / nmcli) to map physical airwaves, capturing SSID, BSSID, and signal strength.
 * Hardware Fingerprinting: Real-time vendor identification and OS detection with built-in "IndexError" crash protection for firewalled targets.
 
🧨 PHASE 2: OFFENSIVE CAPABILITIES
 * NSE Vulnerability Linker: Direct integration with the Nmap Scripting Engine to identify high-risk CVEs on active targets.
 * SSH Brute-Force Module: Automated credential stress-testing specifically engineered for port 22 interception.
 * Payload Forge: Instant generation of stabilized, one-liner reverse shells for rapid exploitation testing.
 * Tactical Intel Hub: A dedicated slide-out panel that "intercepts" and displays all captured data for a specific IP.
 
🛡️ PHASE 3: STEALTH & OPERATIONS
 * RTT Speed Tuning: Packet timeouts optimized at 250ms to maintain high-velocity scans even in high-latency environments.
 * The Panic Killswitch: A one-click emergency termination protocol that kills all backend processes and clears session memory.
 
🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
| MODULE | TECHNOLOGY | ROLE |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Python / Flask-SocketIO | Real-time bi-directional data streaming. |
| Engine | Nmap / Subprocess | High-performance packet manipulation. |
| Frontend | D3.js / Bootstrap 5 | Professional, high-rank tactical visualization. |
| Discovery | Threaded Parallelism | Prevents engine lag and "Out of Range" errors. |

🚦 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
1. Secure the Perimeter (Requirements)
 * OS: Windows (Admin) or Linux (Sudo) for hardware access.
 * Tools: Nmap must be present in the system PATH.
 * Python Dependencies:
   pip install flask flask-socketio python-nmap

2. Launch the Protocol
python main.py

Access the Command Center at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

🎮 OPERATION MANUAL
 * Initialize: Enter the target subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) and hit Engage Map.
 * Intercept: Click any green node to pull its data into the Intel Hub.
 * Execute: Use the Vuln Scan or Brute SSH buttons to begin offensive analysis.
 * Survey: Toggle WiFi Range to see the physical signal landscape around you.
